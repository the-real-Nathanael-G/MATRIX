# MATRIX

Custom-made Library of matrix-related math functions. Made for use in the Arduino IDE, mainly to do matrix maths on ESP32s.



Nominal numbers are index 1 (e.g. Matrix A(3, 1) defines a 1x3 column Matrix)

Ordinal numbers are index 0 (e.g. A(2, 0) will retrieve value at column 1, row 3)



Dependencies:

-Arduino.h

-math.h
